# Item Catalog

This is a simple web application that provides a list of items within a variety of categories as well as provides a user registration and authentication system. Registered users will have the ability to post, edit and delete their own items.

## Set Up and installations

1. Log in to your Git hub account and clone the [fullstack-nanodegree-vm repository](https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm).

2. Search for the "catalog" folder and replace it with the contents of this respository.

## Usage

Launch the Vagrant VM from inside the *vagrant* folder with the command:

`vagrant up`

Then access the shell with the command:

`vagrant ssh`

Then change directory to the catalog folder:

`cd /vagrant/catalog`

Then run the application:

`python application.py`

After this you will be able to browse the application at this URL:

`http://localhost:5000/`
